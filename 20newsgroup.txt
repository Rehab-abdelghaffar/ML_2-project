README for 20 Newsgroups Dataset
Categories: ["talk.religion.misc", "comp.graphics", "sci.space"]
Project Overview
Weâ€™re going to work on an Unsupervised Learning Document Clustering Project, where weâ€™ll apply clustering algorithms to datasets focused on diverse text data sources.

This part of the project focuses on the 20 Newsgroups Datasetâ€”a collection of approximately 20,000 news articles organized into different categories. Weâ€™ll use a subset of categories to focus our analysis:

talk.religion.misc: Discussions and debates on religion and philosophy.

comp.graphics: Technical content related to computer graphics, rendering, and 3D modeling.

sci.space: Articles covering astronomy, space exploration, and scientific breakthroughs in space technology.

Key Tasks
âœ… Data Collection & Preprocessing

The project uses a filtered subset of the 20 Newsgroups Dataset, focusing on the three categories:
talk.religion.misc, comp.graphics, and sci.space.

Preprocessing involves cleaning text (removing headers, footers, special characters) and tokenization for feature extraction.

âœ… Feature Extraction

Represent text using:

TF-IDF Vectorization for capturing term importance across documents.

Optional: Word Embeddings for semantic representation (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe).

âœ… Clustering

Apply clustering techniques to group similar documents:

K-Means Clustering for partitioning text data into predefined clusters.

Hierarchical Clustering to discover nested document relationships.

Gaussian Mixture Models for soft clustering.

âœ… Evaluation

Evaluate clustering performance using metrics such as:

Silhouette Score: Measures how well-separated clusters are.

Purity Score: Quantifies the alignment of clusters with original categories.

âœ… Visualizations

Visualize clusters in lower-dimensional spaces using:

t-SNE for non-linear dimensionality reduction.

PCA to identify principal components.

Dendrograms for hierarchical cluster representation.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Data: Raw and processed datasets.

Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Clustering: Implementation of K-Means, Hierarchical, and GMM algorithms.
